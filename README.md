# Overview

This document describes the features of the rpi_3 BSP/PSL, which is designed
to run on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ board. This is an ARM Cortex-A53
processor-based platform.

# Prerequisite(s)

* You must have Wind River® VxWorks® 7 SR0620 released source code and
  development environment to support "Raspberry Pi 3B/B+ unsupported BSP".

# Building and Using

### Preparation

IMPORTANT: Your existing VxWorks 7 installation may already contains the rpi_3 BSP 
and bcm2837 PSL, please check the following installation location to see whether the 
BSP and PSL existed already. 
The rpi_3 BSP is installed at:
```Bash
***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/unsupported/rpi_3/rpi_3-W.X.Y.Z
```
The bcm2837 PSL is installed at:
```Bash
***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/unsupported/rpi_3/bcm2837-W.X.Y.Z
```
If the installed version of BSP/PSL is the same or newer than the Open Source BSP 
published here, there's no need to download and install the Open Source BSP from 
GitHub again.

If your existing VxWorks 7 installation contains older version of rpi_3 BSP and 
bcm2837 PSL, it's recommended to download the latest code from GitHub and then 
install.

### Download

Download all layers from Github.
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Wind-River/vxw7-bsp-raspberry-pi.git
cd vxw7-bsp-raspberry-pi
```

### Installation

There are two ways to install this BSP: inside existing VxWorks 7 Installation or outside
existing VxWorks 7 Installation.

#### Install into the source tree

All layers in this BSP go to their respective destination among the existing installation. 
The advantage is the BSP will always be accessible once you complete the installation. The 
disadvantage is you can't shut down this BSP unless you manually delete all the installed 
layers among the source tree.

Here's how it’s done:

```Bash
cp -r rpi_3-W.X.Y.Z ***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/unsupported/rpi_3/
cp -r bcm2837-W.X.Y.Z ***installDir***/vxworks-7/pkgs_v2/unsupported/rpi_3/
```

#### Install beside the source tree

All layers are copied in a place that's outside the default scanning folder, i.e., 
vxworks-7/pkgs_v2, and when launching the Development Shell or Workbench, the path containing 
this BSP is provided to the development environment. The advantage of this method is obvious, 
the package can be easily turn on or off, and the source code stays in one unified location 
external to the default installation, which makes it easier to manage.

Suppose all packages are in /home/rpi_3/, then do the following when launching wrenv
or Workbench:

```Bash
export WIND_LAYER_PATHS=/home/rpi_3
export WIND_BSP_PATHS=/home/rpi_3
```
then enter into the existing VxWorks 7 installation directory
```Bash
cd ***installDir***
```
if use the Development Shell
```Bash
./wrenv.sh -p vxworks-7
```
or Workbench
```Bash
./workbench-4/startWorkbench.sh
```

### Building

The building process comprises three parts, U-Boot, VSB project and VIP project.
A Wind River-compiled U-boot image had been added into this BSP, you can use it 
directly. Alternatively, you can get the U-Boot code from related official server. 
The building processes of these three parts are all described in target.txt. Target.txt 
can be found under rpi_3-W.X.Y.Z directory.
